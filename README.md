AI-Powered Investment Recommender
Overview

The AI-Powered Investment Recommender is a full-stack web application that generates personalized investment recommendations based on user-defined preferences such as risk tolerance, investment goals, and areas of interest.

The system integrates OpenAI’s GPT model to produce structured recommendations, explanations, and relevance scores. The objective of the project is to demonstrate how AI-driven reasoning can be embedded into an interactive decision-support tool.

Features
Personalized Recommendations

Users provide inputs including risk tolerance, investment goals, and areas of interest. The system generates tailored investment suggestions aligned with those preferences.

AI-Generated Explanations

Each recommendation includes a justification generated by the GPT model explaining why the investment matches the user’s profile.

Relevance Scoring

Every suggestion is assigned a relevance score based on alignment with user preferences and investment characteristics.

Data Visualization

Relevance scores are displayed using bar charts built with Chart.js to allow easy comparison between options.

Export Options

Users can export their recommendations as text, download them as a PDF, or copy them to the clipboard.
