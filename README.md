AI-Powered Investment Recommender
Overview

The AI-Powered Investment Recommender is a full-stack web application that generates personalized investment recommendations based on user-defined preferences such as risk tolerance, investment goals, and areas of interest.

The system integrates OpenAI’s GPT model to produce structured recommendations, detailed justifications, and relevance scoring. The goal of the project is to demonstrate how AI-driven reasoning can be embedded into an interactive decision-support tool.

Key Features
Personalized Recommendations

Users input their:

Risk tolerance

Investment goals

Areas of interest

The system generates tailored investment suggestions aligned with those preferences.

AI-Generated Justifications

Each recommendation includes a clear explanation generated by a GPT model, outlining why the investment matches the user’s profile.

Relevance Scoring

Every suggestion is assigned a relevance score based on alignment with risk profile, potential returns, and user-defined criteria.

Data Visualization

Interactive bar charts display relevance scores using Chart.js for quick comparison and interpretability.

Export & Sharing

Users can:

Export recommendations as text

Download as PDF
